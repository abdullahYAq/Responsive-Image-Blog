# Responsive Images: Project Part 1 #

## Your Goals: ##

* Make the images fit in their containers in the viewport.
* Restrain the width of the blog.
* Drop the page weight.


## Current Problems with the Page ##

* The text is readable, but the images overflow the viewport.
* Page weight is massive: the images have been saved as JPEGs at low quality, but they're still too big.
* The headings, body text and images are not styled, making the post hard to read and dull to look at.
